					<p>As with shopping <a href="https://www.inyourpocket.com/latvia" target="_blank">In Your Pocket</a> and <a href="http://www.anothertravelguide.com/destinations/europe/latvia/riga" target="_blank">Another Travel Guide</a> are two good websites where to look for more information. However below are a few local favourites. </p>
					<p><span>On a budget</span>. Eating out on a budget is not as hard as you might think, especially if you like to eat like locals whose main meal of the day is lunch not dinner. There are many places around the city that offer lunch specials, often with either one or two dishes and something to drink. Best part it can cost you only around 5EUR. <a href="http://www.indexcafe.lv/en/site" target="_blank">Index Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.miit.lv/en" target="_blank">Miit Cafe</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DADcafe/" target="_blank"> DAD cafe</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Muklajs/" target="_blank"> Muklajs</a> and <a href="http://www.andaluzijassuns.lv/" target="_blank">Andalūdzijas suns</a> all have great prices for lunch and portion sizes are quite decent too. One place where both locals and tourists love to go is Lido. There are a few of them across the city, but the most popular is <a href="http://www.lido.lv/eng/companies/restaurants/recreation_centre/">this</a> one. There you can choose go to the beer cellar, restaurant or the bistro (which is the most popular one). There is also a large recreation park for kids and adults alike. The prices are fairly democratic, but if you go there with a hungry belly, you might get a larger than expected bill.</p>
					<p><span>Mid-range prices</span>. <a href="http://www.rocketbean.lv/en/"> Rocket Bean Fuel</a>, <a href="http://www.lakanna.lv/en/">La Kanna</a>, <a href="http://www.makonis.eu/">Mākonis</a>, <a href="http://www.cydonia.lv/">Cydonia</a> and a beer cafe <a href="http://www.valmiermuiza.lv/en/news">Valmiermuiža</a> are reasonably priced and are always full with locals.</p>
